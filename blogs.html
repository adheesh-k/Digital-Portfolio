  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Personally, I am not suprised with the downfall of Chegg with the rise of ChatGPT. Chegg is a paid service and not all students are willing to pay for a service just to recieve answers online. However, ChatGPT is can be used in a free version and is therefore more accessible and attractive to students. If Chegg wants to survive as a company, they should implement AI into their services in order to match ChatGPT as well as using the community aspect of the platform to better cater to students. They should also create a free version, perhaps with ads, in order to be more accessible.</p>
