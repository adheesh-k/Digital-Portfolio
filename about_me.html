<h2>Experience in Computer Science</h2>

<p>I started to use computers on my own around when I was 1 and 1/2 years old, fueling my passion for technology at a very young age. I got my first taste of coding in elementary and middle school, learning JavaScript through Khan Academy and doing various coding projects through Scratch and Lego Mindstorms. In high school, I got hands-on programming experience through the Swift programming language. In my junior year, I wrote a 4,000 word essay on machine learning algorithms in self-driving vehicles. Currently, in my senior year, I am Vice President of the Computer Science Forum Board, which controls Computer Science Club and overlooks the operations of all CS-related clubs and programs at my school.<p>
