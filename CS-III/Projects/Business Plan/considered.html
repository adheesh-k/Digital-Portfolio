    <h1>Considered ISPs</h1>

  <h2 id="ProgrammingLangConvert" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Programming Language Converter</h2>
  <p><a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-ye/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a></p>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Overall, I think this idea is a great concept. Converting from one programming language to another would be very useful, as many programmers will not be proficent in all programming languages. However, I do not believe that this idea is feasible to implement, as each major programming language has its own purposes. There will only be a few scenarios where one programming languages can be converted into another, and these will mostly be simple problems where not much code is required.</p>

  <h2 id="StudentProdApp" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Student Productivity App</h2>
  <p><a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/danelle-corbita/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a></p>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This product will help students with time management and productivity. I like this ISP idea because it is relatively easy to implement and it will have a lot of real-world applicability. The main reason why I have not chosen to work on this project is becuase it there are many productivity apps available today that many students use, such as Google Calendar, Notion, Evernote, etc.</p>

  <h2 id="SchoolFood" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">"SchoolFood" App</h2>
  <p><a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a></p>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This idea is for an app that allows students to order their lunch from the school cafeteria online. The main goal of this app is to minimize long lines and wait times in school cafeterias, which is especially prevalent in our school. However, I believe that this will not be easy to implement, as school cafeterias can sometimes be under-staffed, and the delivery of food may take extensive amounts of time. Moreover, it will be difficult to convince many schools to adopt this system, as they will have to uproot their existing system in order to switch to this new one.</p>

  <h2 id="SocialMediaBot" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Social Media Bot</h2>
  <p><a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aidan-valva/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a></p>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This product is a bot that goes through data from social media platforms in order to help a business gain a better understanding of their target audience and work towards better consumer interaction. In my opinion, social media platforms are an excellent platform for companies to advertise their products and reach their target audiences. However, many social media platforms already have an existing methods of connecting businesses to their consumers, and problems regarding ethicality could arise through using the data of users without their consent.</p>

  <h2 id="PlaceHolder" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">"PlaceHolder"</h2>
  <p><a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a></p>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This ISP allows for privacy with phone and computer screens, where it will automatically shut off if someone besides the user is looking at the screen. I believe that privacy on our devices is crucial. Especially today, we keep a lot of crucial information on our phones, laptops, etc. which we do not want leaked to others. However, I believe that this product can have a lot of bugs, there will many many cases where the product can be accidentally triggerd and accidentally shut off the screen. Moreover, this problem can be solved by using a privacy screen protector.</p>

  <h2 id="AvailableTables" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Available Tables</h2>
  <a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/kripa-tailor/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This ISP is an app to make reservations at restaurants, which helps with seeing the wait times for restaurant and not making any calls. However, this concept already exists today. This is essentially the same concept as OpenTable, an app for reservations which is widely used by mny restaurants and consumers today.</p>

  <h2 id="AeroFli" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">AeroFli</h2>
  <a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/tahmid-rahman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This is an self-flying algorithm for a plane. While I think that this idea is very neat and will have a lot of real-world applicability, it will not be easy to implement. Especially with the time and resources for this project, it will be very difficult to successfully build and test this within a matter of months.</p>

  <h2 id="ChildrenInHotCars" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Unattended Children in Hot Cars</h2>
  <a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vijay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">I think that this concept is brilliant and will save a lot of deaths from unattended children in hot cars. However, the only problem that I see is that many car brands are developing a "Check Back Seat" feature in their vehicles nowadays, so I do not think that this is product will become successful in the long run.</p>

  <h2 id="AutoGarden" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Automated Garden (My Proposed ISP)</h2>
  <p><a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/adheesh-katru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a></p>
   <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">While my partner and I believe that our project is creative, we have ultimately chosen to abandon it because we believe that it will not have much of a real-world impact. Our project will only work on a small-scale, only being able to grow a few small plants. Moreover, we have found an ISP that we believe to be better than ours (shown below).</p>


  <h2 id="Window Shades" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Automated Window Shades (Selected)</h2>
  <p><a style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%" href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/heng-yi-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a></p>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">This product automates window shades with the goal of saving energy consumption in homes. I have chosen this ISP because it is both real-world applicable and easy to implement. Many homeowners would want to save money on their electricity bill, and environmental organizations would want to reduce the consumption of energy, especially through non-renewable sources. The automation of window shades could help with the regulation of temperature in homes, as sunlight can warm up homes through windows. This will be relatively easy to implement, as the main computer is a Raspberry Pi connected to a motor which controlls existing window shades. The computer will use sensors for sunlight and indoor temperature, as well as APIs for weather in order to determine the optimal amount of sunlight coming through the window shades.</p>
