  <h2 id="Identity" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Identity</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Automated Plantation is a revolutionary idea to bring freshly grown produce to the homes of millions of people around the world. The concern for organic and locally sourced produce has grown to an all time high that we wish to solve.</p>

  <h2 id="Problem" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Problem</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">The problem with our current means of obtaining produce from stores is the uncertainty of where of goods come from. Shoppers constantly search for labels such as "Non-GMO", however, there still lies an inherent risk of trusting the word of an unknown business. Another issue is that trustworthy, locally grown produce is not always available nor easy to find.</p>

  <h2 id="Solution" style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Solution</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Our team has created a solution to bring trustworthy produce to every home. Our product is an automated environment built to grow organic produce!
