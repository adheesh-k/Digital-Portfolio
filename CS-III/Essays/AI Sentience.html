    <h2>Sentient AI Will Lead to the Downfall of Humans </h2>
    
    <p>
      
	Artificial Intelligence has had a growing presence in our everyday lives, from the algorithms behind our social media feeds to the safety systems on our cars. AI will only continue to grow as we as humans continue to have an increased reliance on technology. However, with the growing presence of AI, there are many speculations if AI will become, or already is, sentient and the possible implications of this on humans. Sentient AI is beneficial to a limited extent, as it can lead to implications that can harm the human race.

	In the creative world, many AI art generators have been developed over the past few years, such as DALL-E 2, which turns “text descriptions into hyper-realistic images” (Roose, 2022). While DALL-E 2 can generate a wide range of art with little time, many visual artists could face challenges with sentient AI, as anyone can create almost anything using an AI art generator. In the future, this could also potentially apply to all areas of art such as music and literature, damaging the careers of more artists in the process. The rise in sentient AI art could lead to a loss in creative careers, as well as the loss of creativity itself in humans.
