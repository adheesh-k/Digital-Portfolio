      <p>

	HTTPS is a secure connection to a website that is designed to not be susceptible to malicious third-party eavesdropping or tampering. It allows the users to establish a secure connection with a website through unbreakable encryption, which is known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). Despite HTTPS security working well for individual users of the Internet to protect their crucial data, private institutions (e.g., employers, educational institutions, etc.) have identified this security as a limitation to their network monitoring and filtering. As a result, these institutions have deployed “HTTPS Proxy Appliances”, which can be used to examine HTTPS traffic requested by clients on a network by establishing a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
	
	A MitM (Man in the Middle) attack is where communication between two parties is intercepted in an attempt to collect personal information, eavesdrop on victims, corrupt data, etc. These attacks can unwillingly give away the private information of users, such as social security numbers, private chat history, IP addresses, etc.
