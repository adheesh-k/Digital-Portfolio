  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">The process of developing the Independent Study Project for Computer Science III is a team effort, meaning that multiple perspectives will be used towards creating the final product for the ISP. There are three members including myself in my specific group, and it is essentially inevitable that our own personal and shared biases will play a significant role in the development and end product of our ISP.</p>

  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Because the three of us aspire to go into the computer science field for future education and possibly career, we will tend to have a pro-innovation bias in the development of our product. Pro-innovation bias is the tendency to look toward innovation as being a readily available solution for problems that will arise (Schousboe, 2021). I can claim that I commonly have this bias in my everyday life, as I am personally inspired by new and revolutionary technologies that are created. However, I do have to come to the realization that these revolutionary technologies are not always created easily, as they commonly require years of effort as well as significant amounts of money in investments. Due to the fact that the development product is only limited to the time frame of a few months as well as not having a significant amount of a workforce and financial resources, my team and I will have to dial our innovative thinking down while instead looking at more realistic solutions to problems that will arise during our development period.</p>

  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Because the three of us are all seniors, another decision-making bias that will impact the development of our product will be senioritis. Senioritis is the lack of motivation to participate in school as well as complete school assignments, due to the scenario where one is a senior in high school that has their GPA locked in the second semester and is purely waiting for high school graduation more than anything else (Nair, 2022). Due to the majority of the development of our ISP being in the second semester, senioritis will be a significant factor that will negatively impact the three of us in terms of motivation. This will only be boosted by a college acceptance, which essentially acts as a justification for a lack of motivation and effort toward our remaining work in high school.Especially because this will give us experience with a collaborative project in the field of computer science, a field that the three of us are pursuing, taking this project seriously is crucial. We should stay organized and on target with our gantt chart in order to successfully develop and present this product on time.</p>

  <p style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 20%">Another bias that will impact the development of our ISP is the availability heuristic. Heuristics are shortcuts that our mind takes in order to reach a solution quickly and efficiently. The availability heuristic takes information that is already available and easily accessible in order to create solutions to problems that arise (Waters, 2021). In fact, the availability heuristic has already been used in the planning stage of our ISP through the idea of our product. Due to the fact that the proposal for the ISP idea was due that same week, we had to create an idea quickly and our brains essentially defaulted to using the availability heuristic in order to come up with it. We initially scoured the internet looking at websites that had ideas for coding projects that we could take inspiration from. I then decided to purely evaluate my surroundings in the room in order to come up with a simple and effective idea for our ISP. My first idea came to me when one of my teammates left the room and forgot to close the door, which gave me the idea for our group to make a self-opening and self-closing door, which would eliminate the problem of people forgetting to close the door. Another idea that I came up with was when I looked at the windows and observed the sheer amount of sunlight that came through them. I then came up with the idea of automated blinds, which would help regulate the amount of light that came in and would drive energy usage in households and buildings down. We chose the latter because it had more of an impact on the world. In this case I used the availability heuristic to quickly come up with an idea for my team in order to create and turn in the proposal for the ISP that week. Because the development stage of our ISP is quite lengthy, we should attempt to avoid this heuristic in order to come up with effective solutions and thoroughly evaluate them before their implementation.
